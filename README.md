# Playground Labs take home quiz

The problem is the following:

Write a quick program in the language of your choice (Javascript, Python, Java, or another programming language) to count the frequency of “words” in a text file. Use a definition of a “word” that makes sense to you and makes the script easy to write in the allotted time.

The program should print a list of the words in the text file and the frequency in which they occur. List all assumptions that are made in the code and the programming language and version that was used (e.g., Python 3.5)

Example input text file contents: “I want to go to the grocery store”

2 to

1 i

1 want

1 go

1 the

1 grocery
